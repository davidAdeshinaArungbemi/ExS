# ExS Library - stands for Expression-Solver Library

## Objective
The aim of this library is to solve simple arithmetic expressions following the PEMDAS convetion

#### PEMDAS 
    ->Parenthesis
    ->Exponentiation
    ->Multiplication
    ->Division
    ->Addition
    ->Subtraction

## How do i use ExS?
    -> Clone the repository
    -> Include 'ExS.hpp'
    -> Call the evaluate function and pass in your expression(in std::string format) as parameter. e.g evaluate("2+3*5")
    -> The function will return the result in string format
  
## Operator representations
    -> '-' for minus
    -> '+' for plus
    -> '*' for multiplication
    -> '(' for opening parenthesis
    -> ')' for closing parenthesis
    -> '^' for exponentiation
    -> '/' for division
